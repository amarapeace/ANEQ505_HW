Due: 04/09/2026

**For complete credit for this assignment, you must answer all questions and include all commands in your Obsidian upload.** 

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Learning Objectives**
1. Practice recording commands and editing code to match your analysis.
2. Create publication-ready figures for alpha and beta diversity.
3. Understand how to run ANCOM-BC2 and how to interpret the results. 
--------------------------------------------------

#### Cow Body Site - making figures in R

**Set up the cow R analysis file structure**
- Make a cow_r directory on your local computer, and inside the cow_r directory, make the following directories 
cow_r  
├── 01_notes  
├── 02_data  
├── 03_metadata  
├── 04_code  
└── 05_figures

- Inside the 04_code directory, make the following directories
04_code  
├── alpha_div 
├── beta_div 
├── taxonomy

- Download the cow_metadata.txt, shannon.tsv, unweighted_unifrac.txt, tabulated_results.tsv, and cow_HW4_r.Rmd files from Canvas and put them in the correct directories. 

**What directory should the cow_HW4_r.Rmd file go in? ~={red}(1 point)=~**

- *Write the directory here:*
#### Statistical analysis and figure generation in R 

- Now that we have set up the correct file structure and put our files in the correct directories, we can start our cow R analysis. 
- Open the cow_HW4_r.Rmd file and start working through the analysis.

**Note that if you open the markdown file in your Downloads, the working directory will not be correct. Make sure to only open the markdown file after you have put it in the correct working directory.**

**Read in metadata ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the metadata. 
```
metadata <- read_tsv("YOUR FILE PATH HERE")
```

**Read in alpha diversity data ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the shannon data
```
shannon <- read_tsv("YOUR FILE PATH HERE")
```

**Read in beta diversity data ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the unweighted unifrac data
```
uw_unifrac <- read_tsv("YOUR FILE PATH HERE")
```

**Load in tabulated results ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Fill in the file path you used in the R Markdown to load the tabulated_results.tsv
```
tabulated_results <- read_tsv("YOUR FILE PATH HERE")
```

#### Cow Body Site - ANCOM-BC2 in Qiime2
**Start an interactive session and activate Qiime2**
```
ainteractive --ntasks=4 --time=04:00:00
```

- **ANCOMBC2 is only available in the 2026 versions of qiime2, so we need to activate the latest version. Make sure to activate qiime2026**
```
module purge
module load qiime2/2026.1_amplicon
```
(When running commands using qiime2/2026.1_amplicon you might get this warning: */curc/sw/install/bio/qiime2/2026.1/2026.1_amplicon_env/lib/python3.10/site-packages/unifrac/__init__.py:9: UserWarning: pkg_resources is deprecated as an API. See https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html. The pkg_resources package is slated for removal as early as 2025-11-30. Refrain from using this package or pin to Setuptools<81. import pkg_resources*. This is just saying that one of the qiime2 packages needs to be updated it won't affect the qiime2 outputs.)


**Filter controls out of our table
```
# Get matadata with no controls
cp /pl/active/courses/2025_summer/CSU_2025/cow_hw/cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt .

qiime feature-table filter-samples \--i-table ../dada2/table_nomitochloro_gg2_filtered300.qza \--m-metadata-file cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt \--o-filtered-table table_nomitochlorocontrols_gg2_filtered300.qza
```

**Filter Samples ~={red}(1 point)=~** 
- Navigate into the cow tutorial and make a new ancombc2 directory for the ANCOM-BC2 analysis
- Navigate into the ancombc2 directory
- Choose the min frequency for sample filtering:
```
qiime feature-table filter-samples \--i-table table_nomitochlorocontrols_gg2_filtered300.qza \--p-min-frequency YOUR NUMBER HERE \--o-filtered-table table_5k.qza
```

**Filter out low abundance and low prevalence ASVs ~={red}(1 point)=~**

```
qiime feature-table filter-features \--i-table INPUT TABLE \--p-min-frequency 50 \--p-min-samples 20 \--o-filtered-table table_5k_abund.qza
```

**Collapse features to genus level ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- We will collapse to the genus level to make it easier to interpret the results. (Hint: We used 7 for species, so think about which number you would use for genus.)

```
qiime taxa collapse \--i-table table_5k_abund.qza \--i-taxonomy ../taxonomy/taxonomy_gg2.qza \--p-level GENUS NUMBER \--o-collapsed-table table_5k_abund_GENUS NUMBER.qza
```


**Run ANCOM-BC2 ~={red}(1 point)=~**

```
qiime composition ancombc2 \--i-table table_5k_abund_GENUS NUMBER.qza \--m-metadata-file cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt \--p-fixed-effects-formula body_site \--o-ancombc2-output ancombc2_results_bodysite_genus.qza
```


**Visualize the ANCOM-BC2 results ~={red}(1 point)=~**
- Generate a barplot to visualize the differentially abundant features. 
```
qiime composition tabulate \--i-data INPUT FILE \--o-visualization ancombc2_bodysite_genus.qzv
  
qiime composition ancombc2-visualizer \--i-data INPUT FILE \--o-visualization ancombc2_barplot_bodysite_genus.qzv
```

## Homework questions: (~={red}5 POINTS=~)
1. Describe one way to get data from your qiime2 outputs into a format that can be used for R. 

2. Which body site appeared most distinct in the taxa bar plot, meaning it was not similar to at least one of the other body sites? Explain why that site looks different. 

3. When generating the filtered table for ANCOM-BC2, what value did you choose for `--p-min-frequency`? Which core metrics parameter should this match, and why do these values need to be the same? (Report your core metrics value here:     ___) 

4. Why do we filter out samples with low frequency and low abundance ASVs?

5. What was the most enriched genus in skin compared to fecal, and what was the most depleted genus in skin compared to fecal (make sure adjusted p is set to less than 0.05)?
	

## Extra credit~={orange} (3 points)=~ generate a classification model to see how well we can predict cow body site

```
cd /scratch/alpine/$USER/cow/
mkdir ml   
cd ml

#remove controls
qiime feature-table filter-samples \--i-table ../core_metrics_results/rarefied_table.qza \--m-metadata-file ../metadata/cow_metadata.txt \--p-where "[body_site] != 'control'" \--o-filtered-table rarefied_table_no_controls.qza

qiime taxa collapse \--i-table rarefied_table_no_controls.qza \--i-taxonomy ../taxonomy/taxonomy_gg2.qza \--p-level 7 \--o-collapsed-table rarefied_table_no_controls_L7.qza
```

```
qiime sample-classifier classify-samples \--i-table rarefied_table_no_controls_L7.qza \--m-metadata-file ../metadata/cow_metadata_nocontrols.txt \--m-metadata-column WHAT TO TEST \--p-random-state 123 \--p-n-jobs 1 \--output-dir sample_classifier_results_bodysite
```

### **Questions:**
1. Why might removing controls be important before downstream analysis? 
2. what 2 features that are high in fecal samples? 
3. what are 2 features that are low in nasal?
4. what is the accuracy of your model, and if the accuracy of the classifier is high, what does that suggest about the microbial compositions of each site?
